## My process

Worked on Mobile first approach, then added media queries, adjusting the gird layout for desktop views. Added 2 column layout for tablet users.
Added small animations for the testimonial sections to run on page load. Used prefers-reduced-motion css media query for removing animation for users who set their configuration to minimize animations.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology
- SASS
- CSS Animations

### Continued development

Will work with bootstrap/tailwind for other challenges.
